SPHERE pipeline notes:
ZIMPOL:
	- A zimpol image file has 2 images in it.
	- The chip is 2048x2048, with 2/4 rows covered. Half of chip is used as buffer, so it is really 2048 x 1024.
	- Usually want x binning of 2 so it is square. (1024x1024)
	- But get different polarizations in alternate rows of data in the binned image. So actually 1024 x 512 x 2
	- In the pipeline, we should extract the two images and then bin the x direction again so we have 512 x 512 x 2 and square.
	- 7mas/pixel for 512x512 image. So Nyquist sampled at lamba > 550nm.
	- We ask for NDIT images. So 512 x 512 x NDIT x 2
	- Always, after NDITs two polarization channels are swapped with a HWP and another NDIT images are taken. so 512 x 512 x NDIT x 2, with another frame saved as another extension.
	- There are 2 detectors, so this will all be repeated and saved as another extension in the fits file.
	- We want to save files like cube000i_j so that j is either 0 or 1 for the odd/even rows, and i is the hwp rotation index. So for one file, detector 1 goes to cube0000_j and detector 2 goes to cube0002_j

qbe_sphere:
	-Works for IRDIS
	-Need to add code for ZIMPOL, IFS

template files:
	-Do we want dual band IRDIS or just single?
	-Need to make for IRDIS, IFS, ZIMPOL

other to do:
	- which calc_bispect do we want to use? _gpi keeps the different channels separate
	- Why doesn't the V2 extraction work properly?
